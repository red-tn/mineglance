# GPU Mining in 2024: Is It Still Worth It?

**Published:** January 15, 2024

The question echoes through Discord servers and Reddit threads daily: with Ethereum gone to proof-of-stake and Bitcoin difficulty at all-time highs, does GPU mining still make sense in 2024? The honest answer isn't a simple yes or no—it's "it depends on numbers most miners aren't actually tracking." The post-merge landscape scattered GPU miners across alternative coins like Ethereum Classic, Ravencoin, ERGO, and even experimental forays into solo Bitcoin mining through pools like CKPool and OCEAN. Some found new homes and steady returns. Others watched their rigs collect dust. The difference between these two groups often comes down to one thing: knowing their real numbers.

Here's the uncomfortable truth that separates profitable hobbyist miners from those burning money: gross revenue means nothing. Your pool dashboard shows earnings, but it doesn't show the electricity bill that arrives at the end of the month. A rig earning $4 per day sounds great until you realize it's consuming $5 worth of power. The miners who thrive in 2024 aren't necessarily the ones with the most hash power or the newest GPUs—they're the ones who track net profit religiously. They know their electricity rate down to the cent, they monitor which coins are actually profitable for their specific hardware, and they're not afraid to shut down rigs when the math doesn't work. The era of "just let it run and hope" is over.

So is GPU mining worth it in 2024? For miners willing to treat it like a business—tracking costs, monitoring profitability daily, and making data-driven decisions about when to mine and what to mine—absolutely. For those who set up a rig and check on it once a month? Probably not. The margin for error has shrunk dramatically. The good news is that the tools and information to mine profitably have never been more accessible. The question isn't whether mining can be profitable; it's whether you're willing to pay attention to the numbers that actually matter. Green or red, profit or loss—the only mining metric worth watching is what's left after the power company gets their cut.
